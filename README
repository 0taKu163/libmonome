libmonome v0.3:

	libmonome is a simple C library that wraps around the monome serial
	protocol.  there is an included simple application to demonstrate
	basic usage of libmonome.

	there is also a monomeserial clone that wraps around the C library 
	and provides OSC control of the monome (loosely) according to the 
	monome OSC specification.

	libmonome was written by will light (visinin on the monome forums).
