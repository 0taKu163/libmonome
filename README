libmonome v0.5:

	libmonome is a simple C library that wraps around the monome serial
	protocol.  there is an included simple application to demonstrate
	basic usage of libmonome.

	there is also a monomeserial clone that wraps around the C library 
	and provides OSC control of the monome (loosely) according to the 
	monome OSC specification.

	libmonome was written by william light (visinin on the monome forums).
	you can contact him at <wrl@visinin.com>.
	feedback of all sorts is welcomed!
